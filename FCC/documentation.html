                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight
                    language. Inside a
                    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its
                    environment to provide
                    programmatic control over them.</p>

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The
                    JavaScript language
                    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows
                    most Java expression
                    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed
                    from LiveScript to
                    JavaScript.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a
                    runtime system based
                    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                    prototype-based
                    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides
                    dynamic
                    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                    functions without any
                    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed
                    methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables,
                    classes, and
                    methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                    you do not have to
                    implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                    To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world"
                    JavaScript code:
                <div class="inquote">function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
                    greetMe("World"); </div>
                Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!

            <article>
                <p>
                    You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called
                    identifiers, conform
                    to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent
                    characters can also be
                    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                    (uppercase) and the
                    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the
                    Unicode escape sequences
                    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

            <article>
                <p>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    With the keyword var. For example,
                </p>
                <div class="inquote">
                    var x=42.
                </div>
                <p>
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.

                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                </p>
                <div class="inquote">
                    let y=13.
                </div>
            </article>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Scope">
            <header>Variable Scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is
                    available to any
                    other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a
                    local variable,
                    because it is available only within that function.

                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared
                    within a block is
                    local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                    code will log 5,
                    because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case
                    is an if statement.
                </p>

                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>

                <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>

                <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
                defined</code>

            <article>

                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is
                    window, so you can set
                    and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.

                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or
                    frame by specifying
                    the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
                    you can refer to this
                    variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant
                    identifier is the same as
                    for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain
                    alphabetic, numeric,
                    or underscore characters.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is true. Use the optional else
                    clause to execute a
                    statement if the condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:
                </p>

                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>

            </article>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="while">
            <header>while</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A
                    while statement looks as
                    follows:
                </p>
                <code>while(condition) statement</code>
                <p>
                    If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the
                    statement following
                    the loop.
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If the condition returns true,
                    statement is executed
                    and the condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and control is
                    passed to the
                    statement following while.

                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to group those statements.



                </p>
                <p>With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the
                    following values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After completing the third pass, the condition n< 3 is no longer true, so the loop terminates.</p>
